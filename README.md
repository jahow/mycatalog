# Mycatalog

An experiment to build a data catalog with a strong emphasis on metadata.

Built with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf for the administration UI.

## Build

```bash
$ mvn clean install
```

## Run locally

```bash
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will start up the application. The REST API is available on https://localhost:8080/rest,
and the admin UI on https://localhost:8080/admin.
